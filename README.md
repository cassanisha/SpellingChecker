# Spell-Checker

Program that can correct the wrong Spelled Words and provide the best possible alternative based on the different combinations probablity.


It's a java code which checks for spelling errors in a file or sentence and can provide the most possible correct word that user might be tryng to write


I have provided the algorithm I have used for spelling correction which can be used to develop further. Though I have implemented most of it but you can still try to make it work better . Please refer "SpellCheckerAnisha.pdf" file that I have provided


Knowledge base or sample data is stored in text file under project. I have not spent much time on this code ...so free to make changes and make it better   
:D
